### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
With 2+ years of experience, I specialize in Front-End and Back-End features using Next.js, React, Redux, Python (FastAPI), Java (Spring Boot), and MySQL, while leveraging AWS, Azure, and CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to ensure efficient and reliable deployments.

Before becoming a Software Developer, I served as a Field Artilleryman in the US Marine Corps, where I earned the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal for my professional performance and accuracy. I also obtained certifications in Emergency Medical Technology and Motorcycle Maintenance and Repair, demonstrating my versatility and eagerness to learn new skills. I am proud to be a Latino in Tech and look forward to connecting with other professionals who share my values and goals.
